# thejake
A scoring system for NFL QB's that is based off the infamous Jake Delhomme game in 2009 in which he had 6 turnovers, and was his birthday. I also invented my own metric called the TruJake, that uses a mathematical calculation based off of the rest of their stats and their individual statistical histories. Application will pull weekly stats from a couple visible endpoints I found on the internet.
